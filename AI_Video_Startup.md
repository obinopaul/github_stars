It integrates a powerful vision encoder (`InternViT`), a language model (`InternLM2`), and specialized decoders for tasks like object detection (`Grounding DINO`), pose estimation (`UniPose`), and image generation (`Stable Diffusion`), making its modular design highly adaptable.
* **`mmcv` and `mmdet` Libraries**: Foundational computer vision libraries providing a vast collection of reusable components. They include efficient, custom CUDA operators (`mmcv/ops/csrc`) like `Deformable Convolution`, `RoIAlign`, and `NMS`, alongside robust training frameworks (`Runner`) and model building blocks.
* **`Apex` Library**: NVIDIA's toolkit for high-performance deep learning. It offers highly optimized, reusable components such as fused CUDA kernels for mixed-precision training (`amp`), optimizers (`FusedAdam`), normalization layers, and a fast multi-head attention implementation (`fmha`).
